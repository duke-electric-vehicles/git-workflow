# DEV Git Workflow

When contributing to any of our repositories there is a standard workflow you should follow. Since you will not be able to push your changes to the master branch of the repository you should instead make all of your changes in your own branch.

### Cloning a repository

You can clone a git repository (like this one) by using the ```git clone``` command. You may need to add an ssh key to your account before you are able to clone the repository. Help on that can be found [Here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:duke-electric-vehicles/git-workflow.git
```
